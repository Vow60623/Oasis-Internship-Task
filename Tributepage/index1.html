        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni, fondly known as MS Dhoni or Captain Cool, is one of the most celebrated cricketers in the world. Born on July 7, 1981 in Ranchi, Jharkhand, Dhoni is renowned for his calm leadership, sharp wicketkeeping skills, and powerful batting style.

        He captained the Indian cricket team across all three formats and led India to historic victories including the 2007 T20 World Cup, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, and the 2013 Champions Trophy, making him the only captain to win all three major ICC trophies.

        Respected for his composure under pressure, Dhoni is admired both on and off the field as a role model for millions. Even after retiring from international cricket in 2020, he continues to inspire fans through his performances in the Indian Premier League (IPL) with Chennai Super Kings (CSK).

        Beyond cricket, Dhoni is celebrated for his humility, patriotism as a former honorary lieutenant colonel in the Indian Territorial Army, and his love for bikes, cars, and adventure.</p>

        <h1>CAREER</h1>
        <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni began his international journey in 2004, quickly emerging as one of the game’s most dynamic wicketkeeper-batters and leaders. Known for his calm demeanor, “Captain Cool” rose to captaincy in 2007 and became the only skipper to win all three ICC white-ball trophies: the 2007 T20 World Cup, 2011 ODI World Cup, and 2013 Champions Trophy.

        As captain, Dhoni led India to Asia Cup victories (2010, 2016), and guided the side to global dominance in Tests and limited-overs cricket. He played key match-winning knocks, with an unbeaten 91 in the 2011 World Cup Final and 183* against Sri Lanka—still the highest score by a wicketkeeper in ODIs. Renowned for his skills behind the stumps, Dhoni holds the record for most career stumpings in international cricket.

        In franchise cricket, Dhoni’s legacy is inseparable from the Chennai Super Kings, whom he led to five IPL titles and two Champions League victories. He is the only player to feature in 250+ IPL matches, embodying leadership and consistency.

        After stepping down as India’s captain in 2017, Dhoni remained a vital part of the squad, mentoring young players and redefining the role of a finisher. He retired from international cricket in 2020, leaving behind a record of over 10,000 ODI runs, 10773 runs at a 50+ average, and countless iconic moments.

`       MS Dhoni’s career is a story of resilience, innovation, and excellence, inspiring generations of cricketers and fans around the world.
